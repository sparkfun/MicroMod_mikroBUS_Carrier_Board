[*SparkFun MicroMod mikroBUS™ Carrier Board (DEV-18710)*](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/18710)

The SparkFun MicroMod mikroBUS Carrier Board takes advantage of the [MicroMod](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod), [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic), and [mikroBUS™](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus) ecosystems and allows users to take advantage of the growing number of 7 [MicroMod processor boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/processor-board), 83 [Qwiic *(add-on)* boards](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/qwiic), and [1079 available](https://www.mikroe.com/click-boards) [Click boards™](https://www.sparkfun.com/categories/tags/click) *(as of September 2021)*, which equates to +51M different board combinations.

The mikroBUS socket comprises a pair of 8-pin female headers with a standardized pin configuration. The pins consist of three groups of communications pins (SPI, UART and I<sup>2</sup>C), six additional pins (PWM, Interrupt, Analog input, Reset and Chip select), and two power groups (3.3V and 5V).

_The [mikroBUS™ standard](https://www.mikroe.com/mikrobus) was developed by [MikroElektronika](https://www.mikroe.com/). Similar to our [Qwiic](https://www.sparkfun.com/qwiic) and [MicroMod](https://www.sparkfun.com/micromod) interfaces, mikroBUS™ provides a standardized connection for add-on [Click boards™](https://www.mikroe.com/click-boards) to be hooked up to a microcontroller based development board._
